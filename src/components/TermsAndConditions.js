          Points are earned for every purchase made at Pioxno through eligible platforms, such as our website, app, Zomato, or Swiggy. The amount of points earned per purchase is determined by Pioxno and may vary by product, promotion, or event. Points are non-transferable and have no cash value.

          While you can start earning points during this early access period, redemption of points will begin once our mobile app officially launches. At that time, accumulated points can be redeemed for products, merchandise, or exclusive rewards available on the Pioxno website.
